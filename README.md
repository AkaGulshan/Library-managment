Library Management Web App
This Library Management Web App allows users to manage and search books in a digital library. The app is designed to add, display, search, and delete books with a user-friendly interface. Administrators can add book details, including the title, author, number of copies, release date, and an image of the book. All book information is stored locally using localStorage, ensuring that the data persists even after page reloads. The app also includes a search functionality, enabling users to find books by title or author. The clean and minimalist design is powered by Tailwind CSS, ensuring a responsive and modern user experience. This app is ideal for small libraries, educational institutions, or personal collections.
